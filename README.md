# 📝 Todo List Website
![Website Image](/public/Image.png)
This project is a simple and responsive Todo List web application built with **React.js**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **React Redux**. It allows users to easily manage their daily tasks, including adding, updating, and deleting todos, with a clean and modern interface. The app offers a fast and smooth experience thanks to the use of **Vite** for bundling and **TailwindCSS** for a responsive and flexible UI. State management is handled using **Redux Toolkit** and **React Redux**.

## 🚀 Features

The application allows users to add new todos, edit or update existing todos, and delete completed or unwanted tasks. The app provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks and is highly responsive on different screen sizes, thanks to **TailwindCSS**. It also features fast performance with the use of **Vite** as a bundler, while state management is streamlined with **Redux Toolkit**.

## 🛠️ Built With

This project was built using the following technologies:
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for building the user interface.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast and efficient bundling and development.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the components and ensuring a responsive design.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for managing the state of the app.
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) for integrating Redux with React.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`. This will fetch all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.
3. After the dependencies are installed, run the development server by executing `npm run dev`. The application will be live at `http://localhost:5173`, where you can view it in your browser.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project follows a clean and modular folder structure. The `src` folder contains:
- **`components/`**: This directory holds reusable UI components like `TodoItem` and `TodoForm`.
- **`function/`**: Here you'll find Redux slices and logic for managing state.
- **`app/`**: This is where the Redux store configuration and the provider are set up.
- **`App.jsx`**: The main app component that renders the different pages.
- **`main.jsx`**: The entry point for the app, responsible for rendering the app component into the DOM.

## 🧱 Dependencies

This project relies on several dependencies:
- **React** and **ReactDOM** for building the app interface (`npm install react react-dom`).
- **Vite** for the fast bundling and development setup (`npm install vite`).
- **TailwindCSS**, along with **PostCSS** and **Autoprefixer**, for styling the app (`npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`).
- **React Redux** for integrating Redux state management into React (`npm install react-redux`).
- **Redux Toolkit** to simplify and streamline Redux setup and usage (`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`).
